### Project Description
Using AI and Machine Learning AI Model has to recognise specific places on the production hall map. 
Program must perform a pipeline of operations:
1. Clustering
2. Classification
3. Regression

Thanks to clustering Machine Learning algorithms can learn how the specific places on the production hall
are placed on the map.

After Classification AI Model learn and best reflect the time spent by an employee in a 
given area (see the description of the input data).

The whole project is also intended to study and review the available machine learning algorithms.

### Data description

1. Train and test data stores information about employees moving inside the production hall. 
Data file stores information about their ID, coordinates (x and y), measurement time and other (unnecessary for description) data.


2. Train and test data was created from the breakdown of data held in the database. 
Database can export data to 2 different files formats - json and csv, so the program has to
be able to read files in both these formats.
   

3. Data is truly used to analyze employee movements. They are not made up or designed only for machine learning, 
   which makes it difficult to use them for this purpose
   

4. The data consists of slightly more than 28,000 records
   which must still be broken down into 3 different employees during the learning process.
   

5. Test data represents 20% of the data and training data 80%.
   

6. Train data shape is always (*n*, 3), which *n* is number of data rows.
